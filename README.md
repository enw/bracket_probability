# statistics and brackets

## inspiration

I was recently thinking about [brackets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracket_(tournament)) (to be more specific, [brackets for a single-elimation tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament)) -- Specificly how to deterimine the likelihood that a specific team would win the championship before any games have started with only the knowledge one has at the start of a tournament (the first round of games) and a set of probabilities that each team would win against every otehr team.
